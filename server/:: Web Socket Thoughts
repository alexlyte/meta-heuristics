 // Web Socket Thoughts

 We have seen that you can establish a connection between 
 the client and the server, and essentially send data to 
 the server, which the server can then process and send back. 
 It seems like this interaction can happen very quickly, 
 which means that it could probably send back run results 
 in real time. 

 For the metaheuristics application, this means that I can, on go, connect to a web service through a socket. This means that I can send a job to the server via a connection. When the socket receives the job message, it can kick off a job. The job can then send back data as each iteration is evaluated.
