# EasyPlan Development Plan

## User Interface

### Problem Definition Stage (should tell you how big the solution space is)
	* Optimize a Function, minimize tardiness
	* Sequence jobs with deadlines, minimize function
	* Assign jobs to machines, minimize setup time
	* -- Eventually, for midterm --
	* flow shop, minimize tardiness
	* job shop with resequencing
	* travelling salesman
	* capacitated spanning tree
	* flexible flow shop



### Choose a Heuristic Search method
	* Tabu Search
	* Simulated Annealing
	* GRASP
	* -- Eventually, for midterm --
	* ATC
	* Shifting Bottleneck
	* PF


### Choose search parameters
	* alg params
	* meta-params 
	** initial solution
	** search time limit


### Run search (should output best results as you go)

### Display Results
